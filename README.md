# Lemmy_CSS

This serves as a repository for hosting and providing on and working on custom CSS for any Lemmy instance that makes use of the default litely Lemmy theme.

With the use of a custom CSS browser extension (such as Amino for Edge/Chrome) you can use any of the templates housed within this repo for the purposes of theming your Lemmy experience to your liking.

Feel free to contribute your own CSS as well; the more themes the better.

Side note: This is more aimed at users of Lemmy, rather than devs or people hosting their own instances. While I'm sure these themes could be used by instance owners to offer more theme options, my goal here was to provide themes that users could make use of without needing the instance owner to implement anything.

To be done:

* Add more themes
* Add dark themes

An example of the blue theme:
